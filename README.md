# Segmentation of brain MRI using the SwinV2 transformer

This notebook demonstrates the use of the SwinV2 Vision Transformer for segmentation on a custom dataset.

To try it out, download the zip file containing the brain MRI dataset (kaggle_3mN.zip) and the pre-trained model (model_segEx_swinV2_medical_21_st.cnn) 
from https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1hPK9cmsPlRbwvBdrGgnxVge4I-9LLW0A?usp=sharing and move them to the '/data' folder.

The model was trained on a GPU.
